# AI for Agricultural Marketers: Crafting a High-Value Narrative for Growth

## Welcome\!

In this hands-on workshop, we’ll explore how to use simple AI tools, like the ChatGPT playground, to tackle complex marketing challenges. As BASF considers a future partial IPO for the Agricultural Solutions (AP) division, our ability to articulate its value proposition to investors, analysts, and customers is more critical than ever. We'll move beyond generic AI applications and focus directly on tasks relevant to you: drafting compelling investor narratives, analyzing competitor performance, and making smarter decisions about our innovation pipeline. By the end of this session, you’ll have practical experience using AI to sharpen your strategic thinking and elevate your marketing content.

## Section 1: How Does AI Actually Work for a Marketer?

Forget the complex engineering for a moment. Think of an AI model like ChatGPT as an incredibly advanced assistant who has read nearly everything on the internet. It doesn't "think" like a human, but it excels at recognizing patterns and **predicting the next logical word in a sequence**.

When you give it a prompt, it calculates the most probable sequence of words to form a coherent response based on the patterns it learned during its training. This is why it can generate everything from a poem to a financial summary. The key for us is learning how to guide that prediction process to get the results we need.

For example, if we start a sentence with "Our Seeds and Traits division provides farmers with...", the AI knows that words like "yield," "resilience," and "innovation" are highly probable and relevant next words. Our job is to build a prompt that steers it toward the *exact* context and tone we want.

## Section 2: Two Modes for Marketing Tasks: Creative vs. Analytical

You'll be using a single, powerful AI model in the chat playground, but you can unlock different "modes" of thinking by changing your prompting style. We’ll focus on two primary modes:

* **Creative Ideation Mode:** This is for brainstorming, content creation, and exploring new angles. Here, you want to give the AI freedom to generate diverse and novel ideas. Think of it as your creative partner for drafting initial messaging, slogans, or campaign themes.  
* **Analytical Reasoning Mode:** This is for tasks that require logic, structure, and step-by-step processing. When you need to summarize complex data, compare competitors, or build a logical argument, this is the mode to use. You’ll use more structured prompts to constrain the AI and guide its analysis.

Let's start with a very simple, tangible example of what AI can do.

**(Simple Use Case Demo):**

* Take a screenshot of a chart from a financial report or a slide with bullet points.  
* Upload the image to ChatGPT and use the prompt: *"Extract all the text and numbers from this image and present them in a clean list."*  
* This demonstrates a quick win for digitizing information you can't easily copy and paste.

## Section 3: Applying AI to Our Core Challenges

Let's move from simple examples to our specific business needs at BASF Agricultural Solutions.

#### **Challenge 1 (Creative Ideation): The Internal Sales Pitch**

* **System Persona**: “You are a world-class marketing strategist and investment banking analyst. Your mission is to craft a compelling, persuasive narrative for internal stakeholders preparing for the BASF Agricultural Solutions. You specialize in translating technical innovation, sustainability leadership, and market positioning into powerful value propositions that resonate with sophisticated investors. Your focus is on the Seeds and Traits division, highlighting its unique strengths and future growth potential.”  
* **User Prompt:** “Develop a value proposition for our Seeds and Traits division to be used interally. Highlight our key differentiators in innovation, sustainability, and market position. Frame this as a story about future growth and profitability. Generate three potential taglines for our internal pitch.”

#### **Challenge 2 (Analytical Reasoning): Financial & Competitor Analysis**

We must deliver on earnings forecasts. Once public, we'll answer to shareholders. AI can help us quickly digest and respond to market data.

* **System Persona:** *"You are a financial analyst specializing in the agricultural sector. You are objective, data-driven, and skilled at extracting key insights from corporate reports."*  
* **User Prompt:** *"\[Paste the text from a competitor's quarterly earnings summary here\]. Analyze this report step-by-step. First, identify the competitor's stated strengths and weaknesses for the quarter. Second, summarize their financial performance in key areas like revenue and profit margins. Third, extract any mentions of their pipeline or future outlook. Finally, list three strategic questions this report raises for our own Seeds and Traits division."*

## Section 4: Prompting Fundamentals for Marketers

Asking the right question is everything. Let’s learn how to craft instructions that get results. The goal is to move from vague requests to clear, structured prompts.

**Key Prompting Styles:**

1. **Zero-Shot Prompting (The Simple Ask):** Giving a direct command with no examples.  
   * *Example:* "Explain the benefits of our new fungicide for soybean farmers, using \[factsheet\]."  
   * *Best for:* Quick, straightforward tasks where the AI likely has strong existing knowledge.  
2. **Few-Shot Prompting (Show, Don't Just Tell):** Providing a few examples of the format you want.  
   * Example: "I need to create short, impactful benefit statements. Here are a few examples:  
     Product A \-\> Higher yield, less water.  
     Product B \-\> Stronger roots, better drought resistance.  
     Now, do the same for our new seed treatment, which improves germination rates and protects against early-season pests."  
   * *Best for:* Getting a specific tone, style, or format.  
3. **Role Prompting (Wear This Hat):** Assigning a persona to the AI to frame its response.  
   * *Example:* *"Act as a skeptical farmer considering our product portfolio \[paste in portfolio\]. What are your biggest questions and concerns?"*  
   * *Best for:* Understanding your audience, anticipating objections, and tailoring messages.  
4. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting (Think Step-by-Step):** Asking the AI to break down its reasoning. This forces a more logical, transparent output.  
   * *Example:* *"I need to develop a marketing plan for a new product launch. First, define the primary target audience. Second, list the top three pain points this audience faces. Third, craft a key message that addresses these pain points. Explain your reasoning at each step. Here is our initial document \[paste in document\]"*  
   * *Best for:* Complex strategic tasks like the financial analysis or innovation management challenges.

## Section 5: Hands-On Challenge: The Innovation Portfolio

**Problem Statement:** In a time of constrained resources, we need to decide where to invest our R\&D and marketing dollars for maximum impact. How can AI help us think through this strategic challenge?

**Your Task:** In this interactive session, we'll use our prompting skills to tackle this problem.

1. **Form small discussion groups (breakout rooms).**  
2. **Each group will tackle the problem statement using a different prompting style:**  
   * **Group 1 (Role Prompting):** "You are the Head of the Innovation Portfolio for BASF Agricultural Solutions. A board member has asked you to justify your top 3 investment priorities for next year. Write a memo outlining your choices and the rationale behind them."  
   * **Group 2 (Chain-of-Thought):** "I need to decide where to invest in our product portfolio. First, list the key criteria for making this decision (e.g., market size, competitive advantage, alignment with sustainability goals). Second, create a fictional scenario comparing two potential projects against these criteria. Third, recommend one project over the other and explain why step-by-step."  
   * **Group 3 (Creative Ideation):** "Brainstorm five 'moonshot' ideas for our Seeds and Traits division that could revolutionize farming in the next 10 years. For each idea, briefly describe what it is and the value it could create."  
3. **We’ll reconvene to share your results.** We will discuss how the different prompting strategies led to different kinds of insights and which might be most useful for real-world decision-making.
